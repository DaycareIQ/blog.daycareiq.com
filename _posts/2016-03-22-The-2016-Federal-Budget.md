The first budget under the Justin Trudeau Liberals contained big changes for Canadian families.  

The budget removed the Universal Child Care Benefit and the Canada Child Tax Benefit introduced by the previous government.  These were replaced by the simpler **Canada Child Benefit**.  Unlike the Universal Child Care Benefit, the incoming **Canada Child Benefit** is tax-free, meaning families won't be taxed on the money they receive.  How much will you receive?  Read on!

Critisms of the previous government benefits were that high income families got the same amount as low and middle income families.  The new **Canada Child Benefit** removes this and reduces the benefit as household income increases.  Households with a combined income of $30,000 or less will be entitled to the maximum amount per year, which is $6,400 per child under 6 and $5,400 per child between 6 and 17.  These amounts slowly decrease as you reach a household income of $190,000 per year at which point they disappear completely.
