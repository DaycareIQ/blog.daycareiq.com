With the federal election over, the political picture in this country is a little bit clearer.  Rachel Notley and the Alberta NDP party released the 2015 budget.  You can read the whole thing [here](http://finance.alberta.ca/publications/budget/budget2015-october/index.html) but we at DaycareIQ know you are busy and want to summarize the section important to child care.

#Alberta Child Benefit

The biggest change is the introduction of the *Alberta Child Benefit*.  This benefit provides up to $2 750 per year for Alberta families with less than $41 220 in annual income.  It is expected to help nearly 235 000 children in the province.

This benefit will begin in July of 2016 and will arrive in payments 4 times per year.  Families with one children will receive $1 100 per year, and for families with more, they will receive an extra $550 for each child, up to the maximum of $2 750.  

The benefit amount does depend on the number of children you have, but also your income.  Families with *net* incomes between $0 and $25 550 will receive the maximum benefit.  Between $25 550 and $41 220 the benefit is reduced and is not eligible for those with a net income over $41 220.

To receive the benefit, you must submit an provincial income tax return (even if you do not pay provincial income tax).  For families that meet the income requirements and that currently receive the *Alberta Family Employment Tax Credit* (see below), they will automatically be enrolled.

#Alberta Family Employment Tax Credit (AFETC)

The NDP government has also adjusted the AFETC to help working families with children.  Two changes to this benefit will help Alberta families.  
1. The phase in rate will increase to 11% (from the current 8%).
2. The benefit will begin to phase out once the families net income reaches $41 250 (currently the threshold is $36 778).

The changes to the AFETC should provide an additional $25 million to Alberta families.  Like the new Alberta Child Benefit, the changes to the AFETC begin in July of 2016.

We hope you found this short summary helpful!  Please feel free to share it with your friends and families.
