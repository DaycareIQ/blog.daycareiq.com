Back in April of 2017, the Alberta Provincial government introduced a pilot program that offered parents childcare for $25 a day.  We wrote about this program at the time and you can read that post [here](http://blog.daycareiq.com/2017-Alberta-Childcare-Subsidy-Trial).

Earlier this week, the same provincial government [announced](https://www.alberta.ca/early-learning-child-care-centres.aspx) an expansion of the program to an additional 78 locations.  According to the [CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/daycare-25-larivee-alberta-child-affordable-early-learning-1.4456598), this will create an additional 4500 childcare spaces within the province.

Locations interested in the program are encouraged to apply for the multi-year grant.  Application forms are available [here](https://www.alberta.ca/early-learning-child-care-centres.aspx).  The deadline to apply is January 31, 2018.
