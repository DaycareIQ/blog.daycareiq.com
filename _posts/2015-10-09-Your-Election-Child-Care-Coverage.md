#Your Fall, Federal Election Childcare Promises

We waited with bated breath for all the parties to release their platforms.  It took a long time, but today on October 9, 2015, the final two remaining parties released their platforms.  We are pleased to bring you a quick breakdown of each parties promise when it comes to childcare.  There are lots of changes when it comes to maternity leave and employment benefits.  We'll look at them near the bottom (some very big changes there, so keep reading!).

##The Conservative Party of Canada  
Being the incumbent party, we had a better idea of what they were planning and only expected a few minor changes here and there.  Below are the changes the CPC plans to introduce if elected on October 19, 2015.  
*  Increase the **Child Care Expense Deduction** by $1 000 to a maximum of $8000 for children under 7, $5 000 for children 7 to 16 years of age, and $11 000 for children with disabilities.
*  Continue to pay parents through the **Universal Child Care Benefit**.  This is a monthly cheque up to $2000 per year for children under 6 and "more than $700" per year for children 6 to 17.  We aren't sure what "more than $700" is exactly.  But we know it won't be more than $800!
*  The full Conservative Party of Canada platform can be read [here](http://www.conservative.ca/plan/).

##The Liberal Party of Canada  
Justin Trudeau and the Liberal's plan to make some changes to Stephen Harper's existing plans, specifically eliminating the **Universal Child Care Benefit**, the **Canada Child Tax Benefit** and the **National Child Benefit Supplement** and replacing them with their own plan, the **Canada Child Benefit**.  
*  Introduce the **Canada Child Benefit** which provides a monthly cheque to parents that is based upon income.  For example, a family with 1 child and a household income of $45 000 would receive $5 380 per year ($448/month).  See more examples, and even find out your monthly cheque amount with this handy tool, [click here](https://www.liberal.ca/realchange/helping-families/?shownew=1).
*  Invest $10 billion over the next 10 years into social housing (which includes early learning and childcare).
*  Create a new **National Early Learning and Child Care Framework** that will "ensure that affordable, high-quality, fully inclusive child care is available to all families who need it."
*  The full Liberal Party of Canada platform can be read [here](https://www.liberal.ca/files/2015/10/New-plan-for-a-strong-middle-class.pdf).

##The New Democratic Party of Canada  
Tom Mulcair and the NDP's have big plans for Canadian children, maybe even the biggest!  We outline their plans below.  
*  Establish 1 000 000 affordable child care spaces over the next 8 years.
*  Cap child care expenses at $15/day!
*  Although they don't explicitly state it, we are guessing that $15/day will mean they will cancel the current **Child Care Expense Deduction** and the **Universal Child Care Benefit**.
*  The full New Democratic Party of Canada platform can be read [here](http://xfer.ndp.ca/2015/2015-Full-Platform-EN-PRINT.pdf).

##Green Party of Canada  
Elizabeth May and the Green Party of Canada have, perhaps have the least amount of details regarding childcare.  We pulled out what we thought were their biggest points.  
*  Tax breaks for employers who create childcare spaces.
*  Work with the provinces, territories and Indigenous communities to establish childcare spaces for those that need it.
*  The full Green Party of Canada platform can be read [here](http://www.greenparty.ca/sites/default/files/platform_english_web.pdf).

#Bonus Section!!!  
Some parties made some big promises and some big changes to other areas that we think parents will be interested in.  We present them for you here.  
*  Both the Conservatives and Liberals have promised to extend maternity leave to 18 months, up from the current 12!!!
*  The wording in both the Liberal platform and the Conservative platform seem to indicate that the monthly EI cheque will be lower for those that opt to take 18 months of leave.  It likely means that you would take the current 12 months of benefits and spread them out over 18 months.  However, it would still mean your job is protected! 
*  The NDP plan to introduce an extra 5 weeks of parental leave for the second parent, this includes leave for same-sex couples and adoptive parents.
*  The Conservatives plan to introduce a 2 year trial program where women on maternity leave can continue to earn an income under the **Working While on Claim**.  Details have been sparse so far though.
*  The Conservatives have also written about adoptive parents in their platform.  They plan to increase the **Adoption Expense Tax Credit** from $15 000 to $20 000 per child.  They also plan to extend EI parental benefits to foster parents who chose to adopt.
*  Attention parents of multiples!  Tom Mulcair and NDP are the only party to specifically address parents of multiples!  If elected, the NDP will *double* parental leave for parents of multiples.
*  In addition, the NDP will make EI benefits accessible to parents who lose their job after taking maternity leave.

That's it!  DaycareIQ's comprehensive guide to all things parents for the upcoming election on October 19, 2015.  No matter who you support, remember to get out there and vote!  We hope we have made your decision a little clearer.
