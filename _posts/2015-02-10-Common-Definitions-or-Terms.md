At DaycareIQ we believe that understanding what all the words and terms mean is important to finding the best care for your child.  Here we present a few of the more common words used in child care.  The definitions come from the Provincial Child Care Licensing Act, so you can be sure they are correct!

###Day Care Program###
A day care program is a program that provides care to infants, pre-school and kindergarten child for 4 or more consecutive hours.

###Group Family Child Care Program###
A group family child care program provides care to infants, pre-school, kindergarten and school aged children in a private residence.

###Out of School Program###
Out of school programs provide care to kindergarten and school aged children either before or after school, during the lunch hour or when schools are closed.

###Pre-School Program###
Pre-school programs provide care to pre-school and kindergarten aged children for less than 4 consecutive hours each day.

You can find more detailed descriptions of the programs above in a previous [blog post here](http://blog.daycareiq.com/2015-what-type-of-child-care-is-right-for-my-kid/) at DaycareIQ!



We used a lot of terms like *infant* and *school aged child* above, here is what they mean!

###Infant###
An infant is any child under 19 months of age.

###Pre-School Child###
An pre-school child is older than 19 months and not a student according to the [Provincial School Act](http://www.education.alberta.ca/department/policy/legislation/regulations.aspx).

###Kindergarten Child###
A kindergarten child is any child that is 4.5 years or older and attends a early childhood service program.

###School Aged Child###
School aged children are those defined as a student in the [Provincial School Act](http://www.education.alberta.ca/department/policy/legislation/regulations.aspx) and not a kindergarten aged child as defined above.
