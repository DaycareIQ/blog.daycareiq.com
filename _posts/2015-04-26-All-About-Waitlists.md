At DaycareIQ, we get many questions about waitlists for child care.  We think it is important for all parents to understand the in's and out's of waitlists.  Here we answer the most common questions about waitlists.

###What is a waitlist?###
It's first important to understand what a waitlist is.  For a child care centre, a waitlist consists of children that are hoping to one day get a spot at the centre.  For child care, there are two types of children on a waitlist.  The first group of waitlist children are either too young to attend or are still at home with mom or dad.  For example, an 8 month old baby may be on a waitlist, waiting for a place when mom or dad goes back to work after maternity/paternity leave.

The other set of waitlist children are currently enrolled at another facility, but would prefer a different centre. Perhaps the other child care facility is closer to home, or mom's work.  Maybe the price is a bit less, or the facilities a little better.  Either way, DaycareIQ has the ability to handle both types of waitlist types.

###What type of facilities have waitlists?###
Technically any and all facility could have a waitlist.  Popular child care centres like the University of Calgary have very long waitlists with hundreds of children!!!  Other operators choose to keep a short waitlist while others prefer to keep a longer list of potential customers.  It is really up to the operator and their preference.

A 2014 survey by [Public Interest Alberta](http://pialberta.org/sites/default/files/Documents/PIAChildcareSurvey-SummaryReport_0.pdf) found that 63% of child care operators surveyed had waitlists.

###When should I get on a waitlist?###
We hear all types of rumours.  'If you aren't on a waitlist before your baby is born, they will never get child care.' or 'Once you start planning to have a child, you should probably start putting your child on a waitlist!'  Neither of these are very true.  Yes, some places have very long waitlists and you may never see the end of it.  But our research has shown that there are always spots available, you just have to look.  We found the resources to find suitable child care were not that great, and that's why we created DaycareIQ.  Our map tool helps you locate child care near your home, your work or along your commute.  We help identify centres which you may have never known existed.

The ideal time to start researching child care is between 3 and 6 months.  This will give you sufficient time to research, visit and place your child on waitlist.  We here at DaycareIQ want to assist you with your research, let us know how we can help!

###Do waitlists cost money?###
It's true, some child care centres require a fee to be placed on the waitlist.  It is very important to ask about this fee.  You should ask whether the fee is mandatory, if it is refundable, if it is transferrable to the registration fee or monthly fee and importantly, how much is the fee?  Some centres will only collect a registration fee when you are given a space.  We have found that child care centre websites often don't make it clear how and when their fee is collected.  We highly recommend contacting the child care facility to ask the important questions.  DaycareIQ has the phone number, website and email address of the majority child care facilities.  If we don't have one, contact us and we will do our best to find the answers you are looking for.

###How do I get on a waitlist?###
DaycareIQ was designed around the process of helping parents get registered for child care.  You can use our service to [create an account](http://www.daycareiq.com/app/users/sign_up) and waitlist for many child care facilities.  It only takes a few clicks and the child care facility is instantly notified.  We have made the process as easy as possible, we want you to spend less time filling out paper forms and mailing them to the child care facility, and spend more time raising and caring for your child.

Waitlists are unfortunately part of the child care process.  At DaycareIQ, we want to make the process of finding and registering for child care as easy as possible.
