title: How do Alberta parents benefit from DaycareIQ?
description: We developed DaycareIQ to help parents find child care in their community.  We found that provincial sites were often not the greatest resource.  We want to show you what DaycareIQ can do for parents!

We have spent a lot of time fine tuning the map feature of DaycareIQ.  We think it is one of our greatest features.  You can use the DaycareIQ maps to help locate child care near your home or work, or even along your commute.  Using the map features, you can display all locations or only licensed facilities.  You can filter by category and show only _Day Homes_ or show only _Child Care Centres_.  You can create favourite lists and keep track of your most loved locations!

And for comparison sake, here is a search for Edmonton child care centres using the Alberta provincial website.  I think you can see the benefits of using [DaycareIQ](https://www.daycareiq.com)!
