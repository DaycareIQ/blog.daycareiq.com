On May 5, 2015, nearly 1.5 million Albertan's turned out to vote in the latest provincial election.  With 40.6% of the vote, Rachel Notley's NDP party took over power in the provincial legislature.  This change in power will likely bring many changes to the province.  Here at DaycareIQ, we had been following the election with a keen eye on how this may affect child care in Alberta.  Now that the results are in, we are able to analyse the NDP position on child care.

##What Does Their Platform Say?##

The NDP have a fairly clear direction for child care in Alberta.  In their published [platform](http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/themes/5538f80701925b5033000001/attachments/original/1431112969/Alberta_NDP_Platform_2015.pdf?1431112969), the NDP propose the following;

>(5.1) We will invest in child care, creating new spaces and improving affordability, quality and access. We will move toward $25-a-day care in quality child care centres as Albertaâ€™s finances permit. 

The two most important aspects of the NDP promise is to

1. create more spaces  
2. move toward $25-a-day care

One of the reasons we started DaycareIQ was because we as parents heard so many stories about the struggle to find a child care space.  It appears that the NDP have also recognized this problem.  Their first promise is to create more child care spaces in the province.  As with most political campaign promises, the details on how the NDP intend to help create these spaces are sparse.  Very few child care centres are run by the province, so it's not like the NDP can just build new centres.  To help create spaces, we expect the NDP will reduce taxes on new business that open child care spaces and/or create a provincial grant program for child care operators that increase capacity.  We can also see from their online platform that the NDP intend to spend $150 million on child care in the year 2019/2020, *triple* the amount of $50 million in 2015/2016.

The second, and perhaps bigger campaign promise is to move towards $25-a-day child care.  For parents this means a drastic reduction in the cost of child care.  For example, in the month of May, there are 21 weekdays.  At $25-a-day, this would mean a single child would cost $525 for the month.  This is much lower than the average price of approximately around $1000/month.

But don't hold your breath for $25-a-day child care.  The NDP in their platform even say "as Alberta's finances permit" when speaking about the cost reduction.  The problem is that child care operators won't simply reduce their prices to $25-a-day.  For this plan to work, the government will have to make up the difference in cost.  Basically the operator would still charge $45-a-day (for example), the parent would be responsible for $25 and the government would kick in the remaining $20.  Therefore the government needs to get the money from somewhere.  So unless we have a huge increase in the price of oil, it is unlikely we will see the $25-a-day child care any time soon.  The NDP also intend to raise corporate income tax and perhaps that will produce enough revenue for the province to re-invest in cheaper child care.

##Is $25-A-Day Child Care New?##

Quebec has a provincially funded child care system that for awhile was only $7.30 per day!!  However, in late 2014, the provincial government decided to [modify the program](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-daycare-fees-to-climb-to-20-per-day-for-highest-earning-families-1.2841994) and adjust the rates depending on your income.  So parents that make more each year, will be required to pay more for child care.  The Alberta NDP and Rachel Notley have put their goal at $25-a-day which will mean less burden on the provincial expenditures and perhaps reduce the likelihood of having to adjust the program later like in Quebec.

Rachely Notley has yet to be sworn in as premier of Alberta, and therefore we don't know much more about her goals for child care in this province.  Only time will tell how the NDP plan to improve access and reduce the cost of child care in Alberta.  One thing is for sure, DaycareIQ will continue to blog about their actions and will always be there to help you find a space for your young boy or girl!
