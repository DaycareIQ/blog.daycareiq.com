There are a lot of great agencies and organizations within Alberta that you can go to with questions regarding child care.  Here at DaycareIQ we want to provide you with everything you need to ensure you are giving your child the greatest care.

##Accreditation of Early Learning and Care Services##

The [AELCS](http://www.aelcs.ca/Pages/default.aspx) is the provincial organization responsible for accreditation of child care centers.  They work with operators to ensure they are providing the best possible care that meets the requirements developed by the province.  You can contact them through their website for any questions related to accreditation.  You can also learn more about accreditation from our earlier blog post found [here](http://blog.daycareiq.com/2015-alberta-daycare-accreditation/).

##The Alberta Child Care Association##

[The Alberta Child Care Association](http://albertachildcareassociation.com/) is a non-profit society here in Alberta.  They help care givers become the best at what they do.  Their stated mission is to  
>advance a unified child care profession by providing support, education and recognition of our members.  

They can be reached at `1-877-421-9937`

##Canada's Food Guide##

One thing that makes a child care centre great is the food.  As parents, you want to make sure your child is being provided with healthy, nutritious meals.  When you first visit a centre, ask them about [Canada's Food Guide](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/index-eng.php) and whether or not they follow it.

##Healthy Parents, Healthy Children##

This great resource was put together by Alberta Health Services.  Most new parents will recieve a hard copy from their physician.  You can also visit their website to find tons of great information about raising a healthy child [here](http://www.healthyparentshealthychildren.ca/).

##Immunizations##

The best way to protect your child from illnesses that might be passed around at a child care centre is through immunization.  [MyHealth.Alberta.ca](https://myhealth.alberta.ca/health/pages/conditions.aspx?hwId=immun#hw254923) provides parents with easy to read information about all the immunizations that a child should receive.  By immunizing your child, you are protecting them, and the other children in the program from diseases such as chickenpox, measles and whooping cough.

##HealthLink Alberta##

Registered nurses with HealthLink Alberta can help answer your health related questions 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  They can help you decide whether your child just needs some rest, or if a trip to the emergency room is in order.  They are your best resource for health related information.  They can be reached at `1-866-408-5465`.
