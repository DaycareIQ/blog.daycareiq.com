Great products are always evolving - that's why we listen to our customers and respond to their requests.  Here we share a few new features that came from our great customers!

### Contact Lists

We introduced [in-app messaging](https://blog.daycareiq.com/2016-Live-View-and-In-App-Messaging) last month.  Staff and parents can use it to communicate with each other.  The one thing it doesn't allow for is attachments such as pictures or PDFs.  We have some secret tools in the pipeline to handle that, but until then we built a Contact List tool.  This tool is pretty simple, but pretty useful.  This Contact List tool will give you the email addresses of various groups within your centre.  It's very easy - see below.

![Access contact list from the menu in the top right corner.](https://blog.daycareiq.com/site_assets/images/contact.png)

From here, you can copy various groups of email addresses to your clipboard.  For example, just primary email addresses, or non-contactable children or just children listed as receiving subsidized fees.  You can "one click" copy their email addresses.

### iOS Delete Button

Customers that use KidGenius through their iPhone or iPad have not been able to delete items....until today.  Update to the latest version in the Apple App Store to get access to the delete button.  When viewing the history of things like naps, meals, activities, and more, swipe left to reveal the Delete button.  One simple tap and the item is deleted, never to be seen again.

As always - we love to hear from our customers.  Reach out to us if you feel something is missing from KidGenius!
