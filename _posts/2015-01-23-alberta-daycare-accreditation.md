As a parent researching child care, you are probably used to seeing the word *accreditation* everywhere. We are here to help you understand what accreditation means, and how you can use it to help find the best care for your child.

First, it is important to understand that there is a difference between a *licensed* child care centre and an *accredited* child care centre. In Alberta, licensing is not voluntary, all child care centres (daycare, family day home, before and after school care) must be licensed through the provincial government. Accreditation on the other hand is voluntary, therefore you will find some child care centres that are not accredited.

*Note you will find some child care centers that are not licensed. DayCareIQ does not recommends these centers as they will not have the proper business license or insurance.  They are also not subject to the same standards as licensed centers.*

The Department of Human Services developed accreditation standards in 2011 together with key stakeholders from the child care industry. These standards are designed to recognize child care providers who provide the highest quality of care for Albertans.

##How Does a Center Become Accredited?##

For a centre to be considered accredited they must go through a process of self-evaluation and a quality enhancement process. In addition to these two steps, the centre must be recognized by the [Association of Early Learning in Care Services (AELCS)](http://www.aelcs.ca/Pages/default.aspx).

Hard work doesn't end when the centre becomes accredited. To maintain their accreditation, centres must continue to work on their Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP). On an annual basis they are required to submit evidence to the AELCS describing their ongoing efforts to provide high quality care. Additionally, centres are also subject to surprise inspection visits to verify they are meeting accreditation standards.

These accreditation standards are designed to ensure that your child is receiving the care that he or she deserves.

##How Do I Find Accredited Child Care?##

**DayCareIQ** captures this information and allows parents to sort child care centres based on their accreditation status. We are committed to providing you the easiest way to search and apply for child care in your city.

##What Are Some Examples Of Accreditation Standards##

>Child care programs demonstrate respectful, positive interactions and communications with children.

The standard doesn't stop with the single sentence. The province also provides centres with *indicators* of how they can meet the standard. For example, a few indicators for the standard above are;

>Talk to children at a developmental level they understand.  
>Model respectful interactions with other adults.  

All of the standards were based on the most up-to-date research on healthy child development. By becoming accredited, the centre is saying that they are committed to providing the best care possible for your child.
