## What Is Accreditation? ##

As a parent researching child care, you are probably used to see the word *accreditation* everywhere.  We are here to help you understand what this means, and how you can use it to help find the best care for your child.

The first thing to know is there is a different between a *licensed* daycare and an *accredited* daycare.  In Alberta, licensing is not voluntary, ALL daycare providers (daycare, family day home, out of school care) must be licensed through the provincial government.  Accreditation on the other hand is voluntary, therefore you will find some daycares that are not accredited.

The department of Human Services developed accreditation standards in 2011 together with key stakeholders from the child care industry.  These standards are designed to acknowledge daycare providers who provide the highest quality of care for Albertans.

## How Does a Center Become Accredited? ##

For a centre to be considered accredited they must go through a process of self-evaluation and a quality enhancement process.  In addition to these two steps, the centre must be recognized by the Association of Early Learning in Care Services (AELCS).

Hard work doesn't end when the centre becomes accredited.  To remain accredited, centres must continue to work on their Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP).  They must submit evidence of their ongoing effort to provide high quality care to the AELCS on an annual basis.  It doesn't end there, centres are also subject to surprise inspection visit to verify they are meeting accreditation standards.

All of this is to ensure that your child is receiving the care that he or she deserves. 

## How Do I Find Accredited Child Care? ##

## What Are Some Examples Of Accreditation Standards ##

>Child care programs demonstrate respectful, positive interactions and communications with children.

The standard doesn't stop there.  The province provides centres with *indicators* of how they can meet the standard.  For example, a few indicators for the standard above are;

*   Talk to children at a developmental level they understand.
*   Model respectful interactions with other adults.

All of the standards were based on the most up to date research on healthy child development.  By becoming accredited, the centre is saying that they are committed to providing the best care possible for your child.
