We've just added a bulletin board feature which we think will help KidGenius become your favourite, most useful tool!  You can post menu's, newsletters, forms, class photos or presentations on your board.  Parents can login into their [DaycareIQ](https://www.daycareiq.com) account and view your bulletin board postings!  It's that simple!  Each location gets 10 free postings.

You can even share the links with prospective parents so they can download application forms or read your latest newsletter!

Our animation below shows just how easy it is to add a file!
