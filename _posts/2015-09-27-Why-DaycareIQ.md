##Why Did We Create DaycareIQ?

When we talk to people about DaycareIQ, they always ask us why we created the site?  What motivated us? What was the driving motivation?  Well it's time to share the back story and let you know why we created the site and what we hope to accomplish.

As you may know, the two co-founders of DaycareIQ both had babies in the fall of 2014.  One common piece of advice from parents was to "start finding child care NOW!".  We were both perplexed by this.  Why would we need to find child care 12 months in advance?  It wasn't until we started to do some research that we found child care is hard to come by.  Quite simply, the number of spaces doesn't equal the number of children.  This is why if you search kijiji or craigslist, you will find many unlicensed child care centres popping up all over the place.  These people are trying to fill a need.

So not only was there not many spaces, but to secure those spaces, it seemed like we had to jump through hoops.  Some centres required long printed out forms, some required only an email to secure a spot, some centres required a visit plus a written form, some centres ran open house nights, and some had long, complicated online forms.  The whole system was, and still is a mess!  Parents are busy trying to find a spare minute to sleep, and instead they are stuck filling out the same form over and over again waitlisting for child care centres they may not even get into!  This was crazy to Brandon and I (Craig).  This is what is called a 'pain point'.  A task or a process that causes people to stop and think twice about what they are doing.  We think we can improve the whole process of researching, waitlisting and registering for child care.  This is where DaycareIQ was born.

In winter of 2014/2015 we set out to build a system that would allow parents to find child care near their home/work/commute and allow them to fill out a single form and waitlist to as many centres as they wanted.  No more printing out different forms and filling in the same info.  Our system also makes it incredibly easy to update that information.  If allergies change or if an emergency contact changes their phone number, all this can be updated in a few easy clicks.  And the best part, the child care operator is notified right away!

We, the co-founders of DaycareIQ have backgrounds far removed from child care, but we have the skills and motivation as new parents to change this industry. We want to make the whole process easier for all parents.  We want to bring child care into the 21st century with tools to make finding, registering and attending child care easy and online.

For the child care operators, DaycareIQ eliminates many of their administrative headaches.  I'll be writing more about the features for child care operators in another post, but let's just say we make it much easier to track, communicate and organize all the child records.

We at DaycareIQ hope to be the first and last destination for parents searching for child care.  We hope you like our site and what we have to offer.  If you have questions, concerns, ideas or would just like to chat, feel free to reach out to us!  You can reach me personally at craig@daycareIQ.com, I'd love to hear from you!
