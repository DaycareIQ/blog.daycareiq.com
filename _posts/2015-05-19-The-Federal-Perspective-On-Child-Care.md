description: Our recent blog post about the provincial NDP party in Alberta had some of our readers asking about the national situation on child care.  We decided to research each of the major federal political parties in Canada to see what their plans were for child care if they were elected in the upcoming fall 2015 election.

Many of our readers have been asking about changes in child care once the fall 2015 federal election is over.  We researched the 4 major federal political parties (Progressive Conservatives, Liberals, NDP and the Green Party) and summarize each of their plans for child care in Canada below.

##Progressive Conservatives##

Stephen Harper and the PC party have been in power since early 2006.  Reviewing the PC party [website](http://www.conservative.ca/where-we-stand/supporting-families/), the party outline their support under the "Supporting Families" section.  The PC parties main support for families is the [Universal Child Care Benefit, UCCB](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/uccb/).  When the benefit was introduced, it provided families with $1200/year to help offset the cost of raising children.  The PC party has recently updated the program to increase the amount available to $1920/year for children under the age of 6 and $720/year for children 6-17 years of age.  They are calling this the "Enhanced Universal Child Care Benefit".  Parents must first apply and qualify for the [Canada Child Tax Benefit, CCTB](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/bnfts/cctb/fq_qlfyng-eng.html) to receive the universal child care benefit.

Given that the PC party has been in power for so long, it's safe to assume that the UCCB and the CCTB is the PC answer to how to help Canadian families with the cost of child care.

##The Liberal Party of Canada##

It is more difficult to get concrete plans from parties that are not in power.  For example, the Liberal party of Canada does address child care on website but fail to provide many details.  The Liberals have identified 3 issues or ways to improve child care in Canada.  There are,

1. Liberals believe that access to affordable, high-quality child care improves life outcomes for children, and increases the supply of workers and worker productivity.
2. The Conservatives have failed in their leadership, leaving middle-class Canadians to fend for themselves amidst a shortage of child care spaces, prohibitive costs, and wait lists.
3. Liberals will work to ensure that all Canadians are able to access affordable, high-quality child care spaces in every region of this country.

The 3 points made by the Liberals don't say much about their plan for child care, other than that they would like to improve child care affordabilty and accessibility.  The Liberal leader, Justin Trudeau [recently hinted](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-hints-at-national-child-care-plan-tied-to-income-1.3065235) at some of the parties plans for child care improvements if they were to win the fall 2015 federal election.  They were short on details but the Liberals are in favour of a monthly benefit that is based upon income as opposed to the PC UCCB that gives the same amount to families whether they make $30,000/year or $300,000/year.

##New Democratic Party of Canada##

The NDP outline their child care plans in their online [platform](http://xfer.ndp.ca/2013/policybook/2013-04-17-PolicyBook_E.pdf), specifically section 3.3.  There are 6 major points outlined in their platform.

1. Providing long-term, secure funding to provinces and territories for early childhood education and child care services.
2. Ensuring federal funding provides high-quality, accessible, affordable, non-profit universal services.
3. Establishing an enhanced and simplified child tax benefit.
4. Expanding access to parental leave.
5. Encouraging employers and employees to develop work-life balance policies.
6. Establishing a law which will protect childcare by enshrining it in legislation, with a Canadian Early Childhood Learning and Care Act â€“ to be a cornerstone of Canada, like the Canada Health Act.
