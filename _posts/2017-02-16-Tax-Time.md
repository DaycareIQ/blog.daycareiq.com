The Canadian Federal government just introduced the **Educator School Supply Tax Credit**.  If you qualify, you can claim a 15% refundable tax credit on up to $1000 of material you purchased during the year!  This not only applies to elementary and high school teachers, but also early childhood educators!  You just need to have a certificate or diploma in early childhood education that is recognized by the province or territory you work in!  

A few examples of supplies that are eligible are paper, flash cards, paint, crayons, educational software, books, games, puzzles and more!

To find out more, visit the Canadian Revenue Agency website [here](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/nwsrm/txtps/2016/tt160906-eng.html) or [here](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/gncy/bdgt/2016/qa03-eng.html)!
