title: How do Saskatchewan parents benefit from DaycareIQ?
description: We developed DaycareIQ to help parents find child care in their city, town or community.  We found the current tools often didn't include a map that was useful - we made DaycareIQ to fix that!

The Saskatchewan government is one of the few provinces with an actual map to help parents locate child care in their city.  However, as you can see from the images below, it for some reason doesn't show all the locations around you.  This might mean you will miss a location that happens to be very close to you.  We believe our map at DaycareIQ is the best option for parents trying to find child care whether it be pre-school, after school care, daycare or day homes.  We hope you are able to use the DaycareIQ tools to find great child care!

Here is the same search, but on the provincial Saskatchewan site.  Even though it is a map, I think you can see the difference and the benefits provided by [DaycareIQ](https://www.daycareiq.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blogpost&utm_campaign=blog)!
