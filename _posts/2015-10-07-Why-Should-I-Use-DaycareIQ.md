#Why Should Parents Choose DaycareIQ?#

Parents have many options when researching child care.  We think DaycareIQ is your best option and I'm here to tell you why.

###DaycareIQ Makes Researching Child Care Easy###
*  Our mapping tool allows you to filter by type of child care (day care, preschool, out of school care and more).  We also allow you to filter by age range accepted by the location.
*  Our companion tool for child care facilities, KidGenius, will keep you informed about what happens on a daily basis!
*  With DaycareIQ you can create a favourite list and show only those locations on the map, making it easier to visualize your options.
*  We link to the provincial inspection data so you can get the best information possible!


We have many more features that we think you will love.  We also have a ton more in the pipeline!  If your current child care provider isn't already using DaycareIQ, you should recommend it!  We think you, and your provider, will love it!
