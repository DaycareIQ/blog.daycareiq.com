We have two big changes to introduce to you.  We decided to separate them from the other big blog post.

### Live View

This is a big improvement!  We understand kids move between programs.  In the morning they might start in one room then move to another.  This didn't make it easy to add things like meals, naps, activities, notes or others to children.  Before it meant moving back and forth between different screens, now Live View solves all of this!

Now, each program has a *Homeroom* tab and a *Live* tab.  The *Homeroom* tab shows all the children who are considered homeroom to that program (whether they are checked in or not).  The *Live* tab shows all the kids that are checked into your program, regardless of what their homeroom is.  For example, if Daniel is usually in the Toddler Room (his homeroom) but in the morning he hangs out in the Kindergarten Room, he will show up in the Kindergarten Room *Live* view.  That way you can easily record toilet breaks along with all the other Kindergarten Room kids!  Check out *Live* view, we think you will love it!

### In-App Messaging

In-app messaging took a lot of work - we really hope you find it useful... actually we *know* you will find it useful!

The old way moved everything to email, now communication stays within the app.

Starting a conversation is easy... you can send a message to a single child, a whole program or the entire location!  You can select children one by one as well.

One very important thing is that only parents that have registered their account on [DaycareIQ](https://www.daycareiq.com/parents/sign_up) can receive a message.  Long story, short - we need to comply with anti-spam laws so we can't send them an email until they sign up.  Look at the bottom of the photo below, we provide an easy way to send them a message asking them to sign up.

Once you send the message, each parent (including any contacts given access) will receive an email notification.  They can then log into DaycareIQ site and read and respond to the message.  Message replies are *only* sent to you, not all the other parents.

You can review your messages in each program Inbox.

Another important thing to note is that messages are sent from a program.  For example, a message will be sent from the "Infant Room".  This can be sent by any staff, but it comes from the "Green Room".  This might seem weird, but the replies have to go somewhere. By sending replies back to the program, any staff working in that program will see them.  If they went to the staff, if they were away or on vacation, they might not get read.

If you want to send messages from an administrator, we suggest creating an empty program called "Administration".  You can then send messages from the empty "Administration" program.  The other perk of this is that staff can "check in" to this program to track administrative duties which is required by some provinces.

In-app messaging might have some quirky features, but they were all designed to make things easier.  If you'd like to chat about any of them, feel free to reach out to us.  Email me personally - [Craig@DaycareIQ.com](mailto:Craig@daycareiq.com)
