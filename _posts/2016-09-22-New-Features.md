We haven't posted in awhile and that's because we've been really busy adding new features to KidGenius.  Our customers love our product and they keep emailing with new ideas and features they would love to see.  Whenever we can, we build these features so KidGenius becomes even better!

I'd like to introduce you to some of these new features and explain how they work and why we built them!

### Multiple Contacts

KidGenius has always been about connections between parents and child care providers - this is why daily report cards are sent!  One of our Calgary area child care centres came to us asking if multiple parents could receive the daily report card.  We thought to ourselves... why not?!

Child care operators can now add multiple contacts to each child's profile.  This includes Mom, Dad, Grandma, Grandpa and even emergency contacts.  Any contact can be given access to the child's information if the parent chooses.  For example, it might not make sense to send the daily report card to the emergency contact everyday, but Grandma and Grandpa might like to keep up to date!

This feature is available to ALL KidGenius customers!

### Attendance Reporting

Building a web app that is easy to use, beautifully designed *and* useful isn't easy.  But we think our attendance reporting feature accomplishes all three, especially the useful part.

Each province has their own requirements for attendance tracking and reporting.  When one of our Saskatchewan customers came to us asking for help with child care subsidy questions, we were happy to help.  

We massively improved our attendance reporting tool.  As you can see below, staff can sort and filter children by a number of categories.  For example, if the staff need to know how many infants were in their care for more than 100 hours last month, they can enter a few values and KidGenius will tell them how many total hours those kids contributed, and exactly how many hours each child was present. Staff can even apply a Subsidy filter and show only children that are receiving provincial subsidy.

We've been told by multiple child care administrators that this will save them HOURS of time each month!  Those are the type of comments that keep us motivated!

### Bottles and E-Transfers

When we first designed KidGenius, we thought long and hard about the possible features staff would need.  However it was inevitable that we missed some.  That's why we were happy to add some when requested by another Calgary location.

Introducing Bottles and E-Transfers!

Staff can now indicate a child was given a bottle, and at what time and how much they had!

The same was true for payments... we thought we captured all possible payment types (Credit Card, Cash, Cheque and Pre-Authorized Debit).  Turns out we forgot about E-Transfers, or sometimes referred to as Interac Transfers.  We recieved this request and quickly put it in place!

### Payroll Attendance

KidGenius has always been about making administrative tasks easier.  Everyone that gets into the child care business is doing it for their love of children, not for their love of paper work!  Staff attendance has always been available but the reporting feature was somewhat lacking.  A Calgary location let us know that a monthly staff attendance report doesn't work since their payroll runs from the 27th of one month, to the 26th of another month!  We quickly made the change to allow them to produce reports based upon their own date requirements!

These are just some of the features we have built recently, there are many more minor tweaks we have made that we think make KidGenius an even greater product!  If you are interested in trying out KidGenius, let us know, we'd love to have you on board.  If you have any feature requests, let us know, we will take a look and if we can build them, we will!
