description: Information regarding inspections, enforcement and complaints for Alberta child care facilities.

Once a child care facility receives its' license, the work doesn't stop there.  Child care operators are expected to continue to improve and make sure they are meeting the provincial regulations.  To ensure this is happening, licensing staff conduct inspections of all *licensed* child care facilities within the province.

These inspections take place at a minimum twice per year.  If there are issues found during an inspection, or if the licensing staff receive a compliant from a parent, the facility may be inspected greater than 2 times per year.

# Types of Inspections #

There are many different types of inspections, all of which have different purposes and reasons.

### Initial License Inspection ###

This inspection takes place while the operator is still apply for the child care license.  This inspection ensures that the facility and staff meet or exceed the provincial standards prior to opening.

### Renewal License Inspection ###

This inspection is similar to the initial license inspection, but only takes place when the license has expired and the operator has applied for a license renewal.

### Compliant Inspection/Investigation ###

If provincial licensing staff receive a compliant about a license child care facility, they will conduct an on premise inspection.  They will speak with staff, and if given permission by the parents, may also speak with the children.  During these inspections, licensing staff may review records or take pictures.  The child care operator will be given orders to correct any non-compliances found and an follow up inspection will take place to ensure these orders have been followed.

### Incident Inspection ###

Based upon the nature of the incident report ([Find More Info Here](http://blog.daycareiq.com/2015-Incident-Reporting/)), an inspection may take place.  During this inspection, the licensing staff will collect information and make recommendations to the child care operator.  As with compliant inspections, the licensing staff may return to the facility to ensure actions have been taken to remedy the situation.

### Regular Inspection ###

Regular inspections are scheduled and occur at least twice per year.  The goal of these inspections is to ensure the facility and staff are meeting provincial regulations.

### Varying A License Inspection ###
A child care operator may request a variance to their license, for example they may want to increase the number of children allowed at one time, or may want to change locations.  These requests will always result in an inspection to make sure the new conditions are in line with the provincial regulations.

## What Happens When Bad Things Are Found? ##

When licensing staff visit a facility, they encounter issues that require some action.  Licensing staff have a few options when they encounter issues.  They may:
* place a condition on the license
* write an "Order To Remedy" which tells the operator how and when they need to fix the problem
* vary the license in one of four ways - change the term, capacity, location, or category of the license
* give a verbal warning to the operator - these are typically used for low risk non compliance issues
* suspend the license
* cancel the license

## Can The Operator Appeal Inspections? ##

Of course they can!  Operators are given 30 days to lodge an appeal with the province should they not agree with any enforcement actions resulting from an inspection.

## This Is A Lot Of Info, Where Can I View All Of This? ##

There are two places where you can view inspection information (including follow up visits and enforcement actions).  The first place is at the actual child care facility.  As dictated by the provincial regulation, operators are required to post all inspections in a prominent place that is easy for parents (and licensing staff) to view.  The other location is on DaycareIQ.  We want you to have the most information possible when trying to find the perfect child care.  We think it is important to know about past performance of a child care facility.  That is why we post recent inspection reports for all licensed facilities.  

If you have any questions about inspections, please feel free to contact us at DaycareIQ!
