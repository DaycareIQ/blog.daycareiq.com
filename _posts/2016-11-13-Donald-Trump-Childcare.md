On November 8, 2016, Donald Trump was elected president of the United States of America.  As with every politician, he made some campaign promises for childcare in the USA.  Here we review some of his promises.

###Promise 1 : Change the tax code to allow parents to deduct some of the cost of childcare.

The details are a bit thin, like many campaign promises but this [fact sheet](https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/CHILD_CARE_FACT_SHEET.pdf) does provide some information.  For example, these new deduction will not apply to people making over $250,000 (or $500,000 for a family filing jointly).  Mr. Trump does provide one example, and that is that a family making $70,000 per year, spending $7,000 in childcare will see approximately $840 reduction in taxes.  The other point is that stay at home parents will also receive this tax deduction.

###Promise 2 : Create Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs)

These accounts are tax free appreciation and individuals can make tax deductible contributions.  The money in these accounts can be used for childcare, afterschool programs, and other school tuition.  Mr. Trump has said that the government will match the first 50% of contributions up to $500 per year.  However, this is for low-income individuals, and that category is not clearly defined.  The maximum contribution is also capped at $2000/year.

###Promise 3 : Promote Various Childcare Options Through Regulatory Reform

Mr. Trump has said that he will create regulatory reforms that promote "family-based and	community-based	solutions", which should help those in rural and low income areas.  This will create more choice for families when finding childcare.  One big change mentioned in [this document](https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/Childcare_Reform.pdf) notes that Mr. Trump would like states to relax the child to staff ratio's.  He believes all this does is promote having the proper quantity of staff rather than quality staff.

Additionally, Mr. Trump would like to extend the tax credits given to employers who create licensed facilities within their workplace.  Currently corporations can receive tax credits for up to 25% of their childcare expenditures, and 10% of resource and referral costs up to $150,000 per year..  Mr. Trump would like to increase this cap among other measures.

###Promise 4 : Guarantee 6 Weeks of Paid Maternity Leave

This promise is merely keeping the status quo, which has been 6 weeks of paid maternity for working mothers.

###Other Notes

A few additional notes provided by the Trump campaign.

- The above changes will *not* replace the existing the [Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account](https://www.opm.gov/faqs/topic/insure/index.aspx?cid=46549ed7-e6c3-43b2-ac52-2ef692133437) or the [Child Tax Credit](https://www.irs.gov/uac/ten-facts-about-the-child-tax-credit)

- Same sex couples can receive the newly promised benefits if they are legally married in their state.

- Some of these promises also apply to elder care.  You can read more at the link above, as well as in this [document](https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/Childcare_Reform.pdf)
