There is news today that President Trump may cut and eliminate the ["21st Century Community Learning Centers"](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/21stcclc/index.html) program which provides $1.2 billion per year to help provide after school care to children in the USA.  Early estimates say that 2 million children may lose care according to [NPR news](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/05/02/526452564/under-trump-budget-nearly-2-million-kids-may-lose-after-school-care).
