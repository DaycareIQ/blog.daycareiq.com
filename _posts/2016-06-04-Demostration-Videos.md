## Attendance Feature ##  

We have some of the best attendance tools in the industry!  The video below shows you how to quickly check children in and out.  The video has three unique situations.  Check a child in while capturing who dropped them off.  Checking a child out and recording who picked them up, and last, moving a child between programs or rooms.  All can be done in a few clicks!

## Add Multiple Feature ##  

We've heard from a lot of operators that they want to add 1 action to multiple children!  For example, if all the kids each PB&J sandwiches for lunch, they want to indicate that for each children all with a few clicks.  Well we made that happen!  Check out this video for a demonstration.
