##Attendance Video

We have some of the best attendance tools in the industry!  The video below shows you how to quickly check children in and out.  The video has three unique situations.  Check a child in while capturing who dropped them off.  Checking a child out and recording who picked them up, and last, moving a child between programs or rooms.  All can be done in a few clicks!
