There are many different types of child care available, we'll help you figure out what they all are, and what type works best for you and your child.

##Daycare Programs##

Likely the most common type of child care is daycare.  It is so common, we even named our site after it, DaycareIQ!  Daycare programs provide care to your child for the entire day.  Typically daycares operate from 7am to 5pm.  They operate in a dedicate building (sometimes a school or a church).  Enrolling your child in a licensed daycare program allows you to apply for the Alberta Child Care Subsidy ([see our blog post on the subsidy here](http://blog.daycareiq.com/2015-alberta-child-care-subsidy/)).  Daycare provide care to children within 3 age categories; infants, pre-school and kindergarten age.

##Pre-School Programs##

Pre-school programs provide care to your child for 4 or less consecutive hours.  These programs are great for children preparing to enter kindergarten, they will help build your childs socialization skills.  Your child will also get used to being away from you for a few hours every day.  You'll finally be able to catch up on all those things you've been too busy to do!  Pre-school program's also qualify for the Child Care Subsidy.

##Family Day Homes##

You may choose a family day home for the care of your child.  Approved family day homes are subject to same standards and regulations that regular daycares adhere to, they just exist in someone's home instead.  Family day homes are allowed to care for a maximum 6 children, including the operators children.  Family day homes typically only have 1 care giver.  They are not allowed to have more than 3 children under the age of 3, and no more than 2 children under 2.  So while daycares have age specific programs, in family day homes, your child may interact with younger or older children.  One perk of family day homes, operators will sometimes offer flexible hours not offered by other program.  It's best to use DaycareIQ's communication tool to check with the operator first!

Most family day homes are part of an agency.  The agency helps the day home provider with registration, fee collection and adherence to the provincial regulations.  Family day homes that are approved will display the "Smiling Red Door" sign to indicate they have been approved by the province.  If they are not approved, they are considered private babysitters.  Private babysitters are not inspected or approved by the province.  Just like daycares and pre-school programs, *approved* family day homes qualify for the provincial Child Care Subsidy.

##Group Family Child Care##

Group family child care sounds similar to family day homes, but they have some differences.  Group family child care often has between 7 and 10 children and have 2 care givers (instead of 1 like family day homes).  They can be from 0 to 12 years of age.  If the group family child care is approved by the province, you will be eligible for the Child Care Subsidy.

##Out Of School Care##

Out of school care provides care to children from kindergarten to school age.  They offer care before and after school, and sometimes during lunch hour or when schools have closed.  Out of school care providers will often provide transportation to and from school.  These programs are great for parents that work longer hours than the typical school.  Out of school care allows parents to get to work on time.  Approved out of school care programs are also eligible for Child Care Subsidy.

We hope you are able to use the above guide to find the right child care program for your needs.  DaycareIQ provides listings for all licensed facilities within the province.  We help you to find the best program for your child, they deserve it!
