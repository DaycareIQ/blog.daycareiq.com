The CBC reported on [June 16, 2015](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/owner-of-publicly-subsidized-quebec-daycares-has-close-ties-to-criminals-1.3115694) that a child care operator in Quebec had potential links to Hell's Angels.  For parents, this must be very troubling.  DaycareIQ feels it is important for parents to understand the regulations regarding criminal record checks so you can feel safe sending your child to child care.

The [Alberta Child Care Regulation](http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Regs/2008_143.pdf) provides very clear rules on what is required of each staff member *and* volunteer in a child care centre.  On page 19, the staff requirements for day care centres* are as follows;

>25 (1) A licence holder must ensure that  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) each staff member and each volunteer who has unsupervised access to children  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) is an adult, and  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) **provides to the licence holder a criminal record check, including a vulnerable sector search, dated not earlier than 6 months prior to the date of commencement with the program and every 3 years after that date,**
 
 As you can see, each staff member and volunteer must provide a [criminal record check and vulnerable sector search](http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cr-cj/index-eng.htm).  The criminal record check must be recent (within 6 months) and must be renewed every 3 years.  These criminal record checks need to be on the premise and available to view by licensing staff.
 
Staff may start working at a location without the criminal record check in place, however as per section 25(2) A of the provincial regulation the staff must provide the criminal record check within 8 weeks, and until then, they must not have any unsupervised access to the children.

###What About Family Day Homes?###

In family day homes, there may be other members of the household that don't provide any care for the children, but are still present during the day.  This issue is very clearly outlined in the [Family Day Home Standards Manual for Alberta](http://humanservices.alberta.ca/documents/family-day-home-standards-manual.pdf).  On page 17, the manual says;

>All staff contracted and employed by the agency, including family day home providers and other adult residents in the home,

We hope that by knowing the rules and regulations in place for child care operators, you can feel comfortable sending you child to a facility.  If you ever have any questions or concerns, it is important to speak with the child care operator.  They are your best resource for questions related to criminal record checks.  You may also contact your local RCMP or police detachment.

 * - although we only discussed the requirements for day cares, the same requirements are in place for other types of care such as pre-school, family day homes, and out of school care.
