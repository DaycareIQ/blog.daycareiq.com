Title: Licensed vs. Unlicensed Child Care - What Is The Difference?

description: What does licensed child care mean? What is unlicensed child care? Are the differences important?
---

There has been a lot talk in the news about licensed vs unlicensed child care.  For some parents, they didn't even know the two categories existed.  We wanted to share our knowledge about child care in Alberta to ensure parents are equipped with the best possible resources when finding a facility.

## What Is A Licensed Facility? ##

Child care facilities that care for 7 or more children at a time are required by law to be licensed.  Licensing is controlled by the Alberta government under the [Child Care Licensing Act](http://www.qp.alberta.ca/1266.cfm?page=C10P5.cfm&leg_type=Acts&isbncln=9780779733866).  Applications for licensing, monitoring and inspections are conducted by the [Child and Family Services Authority](http://humanservices.alberta.ca/services-near-you/15010.html).

Facilities with 6 or less children (not including the operators own children) are not required to be licensed, and are considered *private babysitters* by the province.

## How Long Does the License Last? ##

For a new facility, the initial license will last 1 year.  After this, the facility is required to renew their license.  If successful, the license lasts 3 years.

## What Does Being "Licensed" Mean? ##

A licensed facility must adhere to the [Child Care Licensing Regulation](http://www.qp.alberta.ca/1266.cfm?page=2008_143.cfm&leg_type=Regs&isbncln=9780779735570) which is different than the Child Care Licensing Act.  The regulation determines the specific rules and regulations that the facility must follow.  For example, the following area's are covered by the provincial regulation. 

  *  How medication is administered and recorded
  *  When a incident report needs to be filed and who needs to be made aware
  *  What type of discipline can be administered to a child
  *  When transporting children to another location or field trip, who needs to be informed, who needs to give permission and what the      child care provider is required to bring
  *  How to care for sick children
  *  What type of food is provided for children
  *  How children should be feed
  *  How many children are allowed at any time (ie. capacity)
  *  What type of diapering facilities are available
  *  How big the outdoor playspace needs to be
  *  What kind of furniture and toys are available (both inside and outside)
  *  What type of records are required to be kept, and for how long
  *  Staffing requirements (Read more [here](http://blog.daycareiq.com/2015-Staffing-Requirements/))
  *  How often criminal record checks need to be provided by the staff
  *  Ratio of children to staff (and how this changes when age groups are mixed)
  *  And Many More Topics!
  
## Is Licensed Care Better Than Unlicensed Care? ##

It's impossible to say.  There are many great unlicensed facilities that exist in Alberta.  However, these facilities never undergo inspections, and never have to show the government the work they do to ensure a safe, nuturing environment for your child.  Unlicensed facilities might meet all the regulations set out by the province, but there is no way of knowing.  By selecting a licensed facilities, you are giving yourself the peace of mind that there is accountability and oversight into the care they provide.

We at DaycareIQ have elected *not* to list unlicensed facilities on our site.  We feel comfortable showing parents facilities that have been inspected by the Child and Family Services Authority.  We feel there are many great licensed facilities for parents to choose from!

#### Update With our new tool **KidGenius** we have decided to open our software to any child care facility!  Contact us at [info@DaycareIQ.com](mailto:info@daycareiq.com) to get started! ####

## What About Family Day Homes? ##

Family day homes are child care facilities that care for 6 or less children in a private home.  They are not required to be licensed by the province, but many are regulated by an approved family day home agency.  They have their own set of standards to follow which can be found [here](http://humanservices.alberta.ca/documents/family-day-home-standards-manual.pdf).  Private day homes also exist - they aren't part of an agency and are technically considered a private babysitter.
