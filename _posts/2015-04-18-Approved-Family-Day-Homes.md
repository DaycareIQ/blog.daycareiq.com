description: What are day homes? What standards do they follow? How do I find a day home in my area?

Many parents aren't looking for the big, standalone daycare type facility.  Some parents are looking for smaller, home based child care for their kids.  Luckily for parents this doesn't have to mean a lower quality care or lower standards for care.  In Alberta, approved family day homes are regulated, inspected and accredited just like regular daycares.  We are here to tell you all about it.

##What Is An Approved Family Day Home?##

Family day homes provide care to up to 6 children maximum in a home based setting.  This maximum includes the operators own children.

##What Does It Mean By *Approved* Family Day Home?##

The word *approved* is very important.  In Alberta, just like any other province, you can find day homes in just about every city and town, and in just about every community.  However, some of these are not *approved*.  In Alberta, these people are consider private babysitters and are not subject to the same monitoring, inspections or training as many other day homes.  Therefore, when looking for a day home, make sure they are in fact an *approved* family day home.  You will know whether they are approved or not by whether they display the official sticker seen below.

##How Do I Locate A Family Day Home?##

Approved family day homes each belong to an a contracted family day home agency.  These agencies help to train, monitor and approve each day home.  These agencies will also work with you and your family to find a proper fit for your child.  They will ensure you get placed in an approved family day home that is safe, caring and responsible.  DaycareIQ is working with these agencies to provide you a list of all the family day homes in the Calgary area.  Stay tuned for more!

You can find local agencies, and also ask more questions to the Calgary local Family Service Authority, [click here to email them](mailto:calgaryareacfsa.info@gov.ab.ca?subject=Question from a DaycareIQ reader).

##Are Family Day Homes Held To High Standards?##

Of course they are!  Family day homes must adhere to the [Family Day Home Standards Manual for Alberta](http://humanservices.alberta.ca/documents/family-day-home-standards-manual.pdf) which was developed by the Alberta Government.  The agency the family day home belongs to is required to ensure each day home follows this standard.    
For example, the agency must visit each family day home *at least* 6 times per year, both scheduled visits and unscheduled visits.  During 2 of these visits, the agency representative must complete a safety checklist of the day home.  When trying to decide upon the right approved family day home, ensure that you visit the agency responsible for the day home, and make sure they are familiar with the Family Day Home Standards Manual.

##Can I Still Receive A Subsidy If I Put My Child In An Approved Family Day Home?##

As long as the day home is approved by a contracted family day home agency, you are still eligible for subsidy!
