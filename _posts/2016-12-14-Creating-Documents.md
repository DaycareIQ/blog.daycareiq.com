Earlier in December, we introduced [Bulletin Boards](http://blog.daycareiq.com/2016-Bulletin-Board).  Our customers are already using their bulletin board to share menus, newsletters, forms and activity planners!  We have had a great response so far.  We wanted to quickly share our favourite tool for making beautiful documents, [Canva](https://www.canva.com).  We think it will take your documents to the next level, all while saving you time!

We created our *Parent Info Document* seen below in Canva in only 10 minutes!  Seriously!

Canva is super easy to use... think drag and drop!  And even includes some free stock photos.

We aren't affiliated with Canva at all, nor are we receiving any compensation for this post.  We just really like the tool and think that childcare providers would like it as well!
