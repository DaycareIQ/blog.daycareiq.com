We have put together 25 questions you should consider when choosing child care.  Which ones are important to you, which ones aren't as important?  Which ones are a *must*? Which ones would be *nice to have*?  It is vital that you set your expectations of the child care provider and child care facility before you start your research.  We at DaycareIQ are here to help with this research.


1. Is the child care center licensed?  Is the license displayed for the public to see?

2. Does the child care facility have a meal plan recognized by Health Canada?  Is the menu posted in a prominent place?

3. Are washrooms easily accessible for children and staff?

4. Is the outdoor play space fenced on all sides?  Are the gates kept closed?

5. Is the furniture and toys in good condition and appropriate for children?  Are books available for children to read?

6. Does the child care provider ensure that your child's registration is available to view at all times?  Does the record include all the relevant information?

7. Does the child care provider allow parents to view various administrative records such as staff certification, attendance records, and first aid certificates?

8. Does the child care provider follow proper staffing levels?  Read more about that [here](http://blog.daycareiq.com/2015-Staffing-Requirements/).

9. Does the child care provider notify you in case of accident or injury?

14. Do staff keep records of medication administration? Is medication stored properly, away from children?

17. Do staff have a schedule of daily activities?

18. Is there proper diapering facilities?  Does that include proper hand washing equipment?
