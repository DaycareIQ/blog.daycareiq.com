We speak with a lot of dayhome operators.  Whether it is at a conference, over email or in person, there is one thing we always hear, that dayhomes are "too small" to need software such as KidGenius.  We want to explain why dayhomes are a perfect place for KidGenius.

### Myth 1 - Dayhomes Are Too Small For KidGenius

Depending on province, dayhomes are typically 6 children or less.  We at DaycareIQ (Brandon and I, Craig) are both parents.  We each have 1 child and both have another on the way.  Sometimes 1 child feels like 6!  Watching children is A LOT OF WORK.  We can't imagine caring for multiple children each day.  No matter how small your dayhome operation feels, remember that caring for children is one of the hardest, but most rewarding jobs out there.  The fact of the matter is that dayhomes are not too small for web apps like KidGenius.  KidGenius helps to record the great work you do. Whether it is 1 child or 6, KidGenius is like your personal resume for all the great things you do.

### Myth 2 - Parents Get Enough Feedback Each Day

My own daughter is in a dayhome.  When my wife picks her up, the dayhome operator and my wife chat about my daughters day.  They chat about how her day was, what did she eat and did she have a nap or not.  It's great to communicate in person like this, however there is no history of these details.  KidGenius doesn't replace face to face communication, it gives it a place to exist forever.  KidGenius allows dayhome operators to keep track of the games they play, the activities they design and the education they provide.  Operators and parents can look in the history to see how things have changed over time.  Dayhome operators can also use KidGenius to show prospective parents the great care they provide.

###  Myth 3 - Web Apps Like KidGenius Are Too Expensive for Dayhomes

We've done our research, other tools out there cost upwards of $30/month for anything less than 10 children.  We didn't think that was right so we've priced KidGenius at the very low end, making it accessible to every dayhome operator.  We charge only $10/month and you get all of our features.  We don't have various pricing plans.  If you choose us, you get all that we have to offer!

### Myth 4 - Web Apps Are For Licensed Facilities Only

Any dayhome can use our software.  Dayhomes don't have to be associated with an agency or licensed within their province.  You just have to be proud of the care you provide and want to share it with the parents you deal with on a daily basis!

### Myth 5 - Dayhome Operators Don't Have Time for Software Like KidGenius

We've thought long and hard about how our web app should work.  We've made it very easy to add items such as naps, activities or photos.  The biggest thing is our "Bulk Add" feature.  Here you can add an item for all (or some) children.  For example, if you take all the kids under your care to the park.  If a about 4 clicks you can indicate this for each child.  You can also take a photo of everyone playing and it will be sent to each parent!  We welcome you to try out KidGenius for free for a month and decide for yourself!

I hope I've answered some questions and "busted" some myths about dayhomes and software!
