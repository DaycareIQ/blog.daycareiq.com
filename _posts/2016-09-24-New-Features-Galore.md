Our goal is to make connecting with parents easier and make administrative tasks simpler.  Here we introduce a bunch of new features!

There are so many features we can't waste a minute - let's get started! 

### Program Ratios

Staff to child ratios are important to you... therefore they are important to us.  See that red arrow below that is where the ratio is displayed for each program!

### Location Ratio

Just like programs, it is important to know how many staff and children are checked into your site at any given time.  That's why we extended the program ratio to locations!

### Nap Improvements

This is something we heard over and over - we just *had* to fix it!  Now you don't need to enter an **End Time** for a nap.  You just enter the start time and can come back and edit the nap later...check out the Daily Log to see how easy this is!

For kids that don't nap, just enter the time you tried to put them down and make a comment like you see below.

### Meal Time Improvements

Meals are such an important part of a kids day!  We set out to improve the way you record meals.  Now you can easily indicate how much of of a meal a child ate.

### Potty Breaks!

Big time improvements on potty breaks.  You can now indicate if it was a *diaper*, *potty* or *other*.  You can also select *dry*, *peed*, *BM*, *accident* or a combination of the 4!

### Easy Item Requests

One of our customers asked us to make requesting diapers, wipes and other common items easier... so we did just that!  Just click on the item and it automatically types it out!

### Selecting Children Improvements

The old way of selecting children was a bit clumsy, we made it better.... waaaaay better.  Now the menu stays open each time you select a child!

### Attendance Buttons

Another one of our customers told us the old attendance buttons were confusing... you know those blue and green ones!  We tested them out and we agreed... they weren't great.  So now the same button from the Dashboard appears on each child's card.  A simple click and you can check the child in!  We also extended this to staff cards as well!

### Reviewing Previous Daily Reports

You do great work everyday, you should be able to review it!  Now you can scroll back and forth through the Daily Reports.  Want to review what Billy's day was like yesterday, now you can!  Just click those forward and back arrows to move between dates!

### Payment Notes

Sometimes you need to capture a bit more information than just the amount and date.  We added a notes section for payments!

### Daily Report Emails

We somehow found time to make 2 great changes to the daily reports.  The photos are now shown directly in the emails (no more opening a separate link).  We also removed any sections that had no entries.  This will clean up the reports a little bit!

### There are two other major improvements... so big that I will be writing a separate blog post about them!
