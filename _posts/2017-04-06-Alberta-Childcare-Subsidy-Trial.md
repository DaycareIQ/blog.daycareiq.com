The Alberta Provincial government just introduced a $25-A-Day childcare pilot project.  The pilot project will roll out at 22 locations across the province.  The pilot runs for 3 years and will cost the province $10 million.  This project creates 714 new childcare spaces within the province.  All 22 locations will collaborate to support vulnerable families.  These include low socio-economic families, women facing additional barriers, lone parent families, and parenting teens.
