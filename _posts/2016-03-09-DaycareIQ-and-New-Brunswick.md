title: How Do New Brunswick Parents Benefit From DaycareIQ?
description: Provinces sometimes have suboptimal websites for helping parents find childcare.  New Brunswick is no exception.  The government site doesn't include any mapping tool to help parents locate the best child care!  DaycareIQ stepped in to help that!

New Brunswick parents have long dealt with a suboptimal site for finding child care.  Although the site lists all licensed facilities and provides inspection reports, it fails to provide a mapping tool to show parents where all the child care facilities exist.  That was until [DaycareIQ](https://www.daycareiq.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blogpost&utm_campaign=blog) came along.  Our mapping tool shows parents exactly where each child care facility is located!  You can search by your home address, work address or just your city or town.  From these searches you can find the best child care facility, perhaps one you didn't even know existed.
