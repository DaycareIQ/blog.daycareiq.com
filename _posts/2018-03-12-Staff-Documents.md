We released a new feature today that we think will help you organize your documents better.  Introducing "Staff Documents"!

Administrative staff can now upload, store and view documents (Word, PDF, images, spreadsheets etc) for individual staff members.  Here are just some of the documents you can store...

* First Aid Certificate
* College Diploma Copies
* Background Check
* Food Handlers Certificate
* Contracts
* Performance Reports
* Work Visas
* and more!

Only staff listed as administrators can upload, view, edit or delete these documents.  These documents are stored on our [secured server](https://kidgenius.daycareiq.com/security) and are not accessible by anyone other than administrators at your centre.

You can also add an expiry date!  This will mark the document in RED when it is 7 days away from expiring!

Here's a quick demo showing you just how easy it is to upload a document!  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to email us and ask!  [Craig@DaycareIQ.com](mailto:craig@daycareiq.com)
