We heard over and over again that child care operators really wanted a way to _connect_ with parents!  We heard this loud and clear and decided to undertake a large task.  We have spent the last 5 months building an entirely new tool that we call **[KidGenius](https://kidgenius.daycareiq.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blogpost&utm_campaign=blog)**!  KidGenius is a tool that helps child care staff connect with parents on a daily basis.  It will bring the staff and parent together like never before!

**KidGenius** will allow child care staff to:

- keep track of naps, meals, activities, and diaper changes
- snap and share photos of kids playing
- request items from the parents such as diapers or winter clothing
- log attendance of both children _and_ staff members
- write daily notes about the childs progress and mood

One of the coolest features is that everyday the parent will _automatically_ receive an email with the daily report card with information about their childs day.  This report card allows the parents to get an inside look to what is happening at child care!

We understand that attendance is an important part of a great child care centre.  Not only is it important for some provincial regulations, but it also helps the staff and parent keep track of care utilization.  At the end of the month, staff get an email with each child's attendance including daily hours and monthly hours.  

**All of these features are included with KidGenius!**

**KidGenius** also includes _free_ featured listing on [DaycareIQ](https://www.daycareiq.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blogpost&utm_campaign=blog
), _free_ concierge  onboarding and _free_ access to our iPhone/iPad app!
