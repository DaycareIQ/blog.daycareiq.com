Hi there!

This is the blog for DaycareIQ.com - our goal is to be the easiest way for you to find the right daycare for your child, and get registered quickly and easily.

Browsing daycares in your city from a convenient map view, along with having information on inspections & non-compliances close at hand, you can be sure you'll find a daycare that is convenient and meets your expectations.

Fill out one single form, and you are good to go for any daycare in the city. Plus, you can be sure the daycares have your child's most recent health & emergency contact information.

More to come!
