Hi there, and welcome to [DaycareIQ](https://www.daycareiq.com)!

If you are looking for a daycare, out of school program, family day home or pre-school program you have come to the right place.  Our goal is to provide the easiest way for you to find the right care for your child, and get registered quickly and easily.

Browsing daycares in your city from a convenient map view, along with having information on inspections & non-compliances close at hand, you can be sure you'll find child care that is convenient and meets your expectations.

Fill out one single form, and you are good to go for any child care facility in the city. Plus, you can be sure the child care operators have your child's most recent health & emergency contact information.
