About a year ago we [wrote](http://blog.daycareiq.com/2017-Alberta-Childcare-Subsidy-Trial) about the Alberta $25-A-Day childcare pilot program.  At that time, 22 locations we enrolled and would cost the government $10 million.  Now the government has expanded this program to an additional 100 locations.  Together, this will provide 7,276 childcare spaces at the rate of just $25-A-Day!
