Ontario is a big province with lots of child care locations!  Using the tool provided by the province, you can get a very detailed list of all the locations in your city.  The problem is that they are display in one big list and it's very difficult to figure out where the locations are!  The map on [DaycareIQ](https://www.daycareiq.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blogpost&utm_campaign=blog) gives you the same locations, but all on one convenient map.  You can zoom in on your address or your place of work and find child care centres that are close.  You can filter by _day homes_ or _child care centres_ or restrict your search to only licensed facilities!  All of this is available for free on [DaycareIQ](https://www.daycareiq.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blogpost&utm_campaign=blog)!
