Even at the best child care, accidents happen.  Whether it is a kid pinching another kid or a kid falling on the playground, cuts and scrapes are bound to happen.  When these incidents do occur, child care operators are required to report them.  At DaycareIQ we want you to be prepared for these situations so you aren't caught off guard the first time the operator shows you an incident report.

## What Is An Incident Report? ##

An incident is defined by the province as follows;  
>a serious illness or injury to a child that requires first aid or emergency health care; a serious change in a childâ€™s health; an error in the administration of prescribed medication to a child; an adverse reaction to medication by a child; the death of a child; the unauthorized absence of a child from the child care program; the commission by a child of an offence under an Act of Canada; any allegation of abuse or neglect of a child; or any other occurrence that may seriously affect the health or safety of a child. 

## What Forms Need To Be Filled Out? ##

The child care operator is required to report all incidents to the provincial licensing staff immediately, either through telephone, fax or email.  The following form must be completed within 2 days of the incident occurring and submitted to the licensing staff.  You can see a copy of the form [here](http://humanservices.alberta.ca/documents/CDEV4029.pdf)

## What Happens After The Form Is Sent To The Licensing Staff? ##

Licensing staff are required to follow up on all incidents.  They will speak with both the operator, child care staff, parents and even the child as needed.  Most often the operator is given instructions on how to fix or prevent further incidents and given a timeline to demonstrate they have satisfied the request of the licensing staff.

If you ever have questions about the incident reporting process, feel free to talk with your child care provider or contact us here at DaycareIQ!
