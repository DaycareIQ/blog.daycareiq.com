Child care staff have been telling us that we need to make an iPhone app!  So starting in December 2015, we did it.  We started building an iOS app.  After a few months of hard work and testing it's finally here!  Our iPhone app is finally in the app store!

Here's what it looks like!

As you can see, the app allows you to capture photos of the kids, keep track of meals, naps, activities and naps.  You can request items from parents such as a clean set of clothes or more diapers.  One of our favourite features is the attendance tool.  You can use the app to keep track of attendance.  There's even a tool so parents can sign their kids in and out of child care!

Here's the best part - at the end of the day, each parent will automatically get a customized report card with all the information!

We'd love for you to test out the app.  Download it on your phone or iPad [here](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/kidgenius/id1074567163?mt=8).  You can use the demonstration email admin@greenacres.com and password asdfasdf to log in and play around with our test kids.  The data resets every hour, on the hour.
