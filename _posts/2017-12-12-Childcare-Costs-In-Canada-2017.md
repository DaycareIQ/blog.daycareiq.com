The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) released their report on childcare costs called [Time Out - Child care fees in Canada 2017](https://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/National%20Office/2017/12/Time%20Out.pdf).  It's a long read, but the executive summary beginning on page 4 highlights a few important stats.  

Likely not surprisingly, Toronto and surrounding areas have the highest infant fees for both childcare centres and dayhome care ($1758 and $1452 per month, respectively).  In contrast, just a few hours up the highway in Montreal, the median fees are just $168 per month due to Quebec's subsidized childcare program (see our post [about the current $25 a day childcare program in Alberta](http://blog.daycareiq.com/2017-Alberta-Childcare-Subsidy-Trial)).

Does it seem like childcare is getting more and more expensive as time goes on?  Well the report out today supports that argument.  The CCPA found that childcare cost are outpacing inflation in 82% of cities studied.

A new part of the study this year is the investigation of rural childcare costs.  Prior to the report, many parents may have suspected that the cost of childcare in smaller, rural towns would be cheaper than in the cities.  However, the CCPA found that may not be the case.  In the areas they studied (rural Ontario and a small area in eastern Alberta) they found the average childcare was similar to mid range costs in near by cities.

Lastly, the report talks about waitlist, something that initially drove the creation of DaycareIQ.  The CCPA found they are mostly a part of childcare in cities, very few rural locations had waitlist.  Additionally, waitlist fees have declined across the country but are actually still prevalent in some parts of Ontario - where they were outlawed by the provincial government!
