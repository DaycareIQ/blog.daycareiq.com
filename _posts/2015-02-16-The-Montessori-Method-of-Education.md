###The History of The Montessori Method

The Montessori educational approach was developed by an Italian educator by the name of Maria Montessori (now you know where the name came from).  Her methods started to spread around Europe in the early 1900's.  The Montessori method actually has a unique Canadian connection; Alexander Graham Bell was attracted to the new educational approach and helped to open the second North American location.

###The Montessori Method

One of the biggest differences between regular child care and the Montessori Method is the age mix of programs.  Typical child care divides the children into groups of like ages.  For example, you will read about infant programs, pre-school programs each of which contain children within a specific range.  The Montessori Method encourages groups of mixed ages where children can learn from each other.  The idea is that the younger children will look to the older children and learn from them.

Another hallmark of the Montessori Method is freedom of activity choice.  The teacher will prepare many options or activites for the children and give *them* the choice of how they spend their time.  The idea is that children are often more motivated when they choose their own activity instead of being told what to do and when.  Often these activities won't have a specific set of instructions, the children are encouraged to use their imagination and minds to get through the task.

Children in Montessori programs will also be given large periods of unterrupted activity time.  Children are encouraged to work through tasks and learn as they go, often independently.  The teacher is always there to help children when they get stuck, but learning to work through problems themselves is important.

The Montessori Method utilizes sensory-motor activities that enhance and improve the childrens cognitive abilities during the early development period.  Teachers will introduce activities that focus on the senses such as touch, smell, sight, taste and hearing among others.

Moving on beyond the early development period, children will begin to utilize specific Montessori Method materials that further promote critical thinking and teamwork.
