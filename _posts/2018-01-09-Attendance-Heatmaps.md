The attendance features of KidGenius are by far the most popular features we have.  With the latest addition, we set out to improve your understanding of when kids attend (or don't attend).  So today we've released **Attendance Heatmaps**.  In each childs' profile, you'll see a heatmap of their attendance at the very top (see below for an example).

As you can see above, the darker the green, the more hours they attended that day.  Sunday is at the top and Saturday is at the bottom of the grid.  You can hover over each day to see exactly how many hours they attended.

We hope you find this new feature useful when examining attendance patterns of children.
