The staff at child care centres are what make a place special.  The staff, or care givers as they are sometimes called are responsible for looking after your child and making sure they are safe while away from you.  It is important for you as a parent to know what regulations the child care centres need to follow.

##Criminal Background Check##
One of the first things that new child care operators need to provide is a recent (within 6 months) criminal background check.  They must also provide an updated criminal background check upon license renewal if it is more than 3 years old.  This applies to all staff and also any volunteers!  If you enrol your child in a group family child care program, the primary care giver needs to have a criminal background check as well as all adults that resides in the house.  When new staff are hired, they must provide the criminal background check within 8 weeks.  Until they provide the background check, they are not allowed to have unsupervised access to any child. 
##First Aid##
The Provincial government regulates very carefully the number of staff that need to have first aid training.  Atleast 1 out of every 2 primary staff need to have first aid training.  In addition, atleast one staff member with first aid training must be on duty at all times.
##Ratios##
Ratios of staff to children is a very important requirement.  These rules are strictly enforced.
#####Infants less than 12 months
Staff to child ratio = 1:3
Maximum number of children in a group = 6
#####Infants 12 months to 19 months
Staff to child ratio = 1:4
Maximum number of children in a group = 8
#####19 months to less than 3 year
Staff to child ratio = 1:6
Maximum number of children in a group = 12
#####3 years to less than 4.5 years
Staff to child ratio = 1:8
Maximum number of children in a group = 16
#####4.5 years and older
Staff to child ratio = 1:10
Maximum number of children in a group = 20

Be aware that these requirements do change when children are napping.  When napping, less staff are needed per child for each group.  These requirements also change when there are children in the group from more than one age category.  To get more information, you can speak with the operator of your chosen child care centre.

##Certification of Staff##
All staff working at a child care centre must be certified.  There are 3 levels of certification offered by the Province of Alberta.
#####Child Development Supervisor
This is the highest level of certification available.  These staff will have completed a college or university level program in child development.  They may also be referred to as Level 3 certification which was the old name used prior to 2008.  Every licensed facility must have a Child Development Supervisor on staff at all times.  When they are off duty, another certified staff must assume the responsibilities as the Child Development Supervisor.
#####Child Development Worker
Staff can achieve this intermediate level of certification using a combination of schooling in child development and prior experience to demonstrate the skills and knowledge needed.  Child development workers were refered to as Level 2 certification prior to 2008.
#####Child Development Assistant 
Staff become an assistant by either taking a course in child development that is approved by the licensing board or by having experience equivalent to a course.  This is equivalent to Level 1 certification prior to 2008.  New care givers may be hired that have not yet earned their Child Development Assistant Certification, this is ok.  Regulations say they have 6 months to complete the requirements, however in that period, they must not have unsupervised access to any child.  
Between the hours of 8:30am and 4:30pm, the facility must ensure that atleast 1 in every 4 staff members have achieved certification in Child Development Worker or higher.  The remaining staff must, at minimum, be certified as Child Development Assistants.

This is a lot of information.  It's hard to remember all these rules and regulations.  At DaycareIQ, we want to help you make the right choice and therefore if you have any questions about staffing, please don't hestitate to email us.  You may also speak with staff at your child care centre about their staffing levels.
