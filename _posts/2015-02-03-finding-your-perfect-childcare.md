#What To Consider When Searching for Child Care#

At DaycareIQ we want to help you find the perfect child care, whether that be daycare, after school care, day home or preschool.  Here are a few tips we have learned that should help your search.

##Location, Location, Location##

One important thing to consider when searching for child care is where it is located.  Many people drive around their house and search for nearby child care centres.  This works well but eliminates many potential facilities.  By using DaycareIQs mapping feature, you can search for child care near your work or even along your commute work.  This can triple the number of potential child care centres!

##Accreditation Status##

An *accredited* care facility means that the operators have dedicated themselves to providing a higher level of care.  DaycareIQ identifies facilities that have met provincial requirements to be considered accredited and allow you to sort and filter based upon this feature.  We wanted to build this into the system to help you make the best selection possible.  You can read all about accreditation in a previous blog post [here](http://blog.daycareiq.com/2015-alberta-daycare-accreditation/).

##Inspection Results##

All licensed child care centres in Alberta are subject to inspections.  The will visited at minimum two times per year.  The results of these inspections are available to the public.  DaycareIQ automatically pulls the results from the provincial website so you can make a more informed decision.  We show users the non-compliances so you can get an accurate view of what the child care centre might need to work on.

##Centre Visit##

There is one thing that DaycareIQ can't provide, a site visit.  We recommend that all parents visit their selected child care centres.  This will allow parents to meet the care providers, view the facilities and assess for a "good fit".  DaycareIQ users can use the communication tool to contact potential child care centres to set up tours.

##Word of Mouth## 

One of the greatest sources of information about child care is word of mouth.  Ask your friends, you colleagues, or your neighbours about any good experiences they had.  You might find they had great experiences, or you might find they had a bad experience, both are valuable pieces of information.  DaycareIQ is building a review feature to allow parents to share their experiences with the interested parents.  We hope you have a great experience with child care you find on DaycareIQ and will return to share that information with other parents!
