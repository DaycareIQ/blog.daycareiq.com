For the past few months we've been working on improving the KidGenius experience.  So much has changed that we are calling it KidGenius Version 2!  We know you are busy during the day and don't have time to wait for pages to load, therefore the technology we have used should make everything quicker!  

Here are some of the new features you'll find in KidGenius.

### New Look

The first thing you will notice when you log in is the new look.  We've updated the entire design of the site!  We've made the dashboard a bit more compact meaning more information will fit on your screen.

### More Useful Dashboard

The dashboard has always been a spot we hope users find useful.  We've added a few features that will improve the usefulness even more.

The picture below shows the actions you can take for a single child on the dashboard.  You can now check in or out a child, record actions such as meals, naps, or toilet breaks.  The staff to child ratio is also listed directly on the dashboard so you can always know if you are meeting standards.

### Better Bulletin Board Access

At the request of one of our customers, we've added a link to the bulletin board page right on the dashboard!

### Better Editing Features

A very common email we received in the past was along the lines of *"I forgot to check out yesterday, can you make that change for me?"*  Well now you can do that yourself!  When you edit any record (attendance, meal, nap, toilet break, note etc) you'll be giving the option of editing the data *and* time.  You can also set the date and time when you record a new item.

### Program Daily Activity Log

You can now view an daily log of all the things you've recorded for a program!  You can even go back in time to view previous days!  This was a frequently requested feature!

### Subsidy Fee Field

In version 1 of KidGenius you could track whether or not the child received a government subsidy and their total fee.  At the request of a different customer, we added the Subsidy Fee field.

### Activity Feed

In the new version, you can now view all the items you have recorded for a child in a chronological feed.  It will tell you when, and importantly *who* recorded an item.

### Hide Photos

Are you working on a smaller screen?  Perhaps you want to hide the child photos to save space... well now you can!  Just click the menu button in the top left corner (see blue arror in screenshot below), the click the *Hide Photos* button.

### Projected Hours

Likely the most used feature of KidGenius, and one we are most proud of is our attendance tools.  At the request of a customer in Calgary, we've added a *Projected Hours* tool.  In each child's attendance report page, you'll see the projected hours for the month on the left side.  This will help you determine if a child is on track to meet his or hers hours for the month.

### New Users

All of the above features are for current users of KidGenius.  We've made some changes for those childcare operators that aren't yet KidGenius customers!  We've always had a demonstration account but people had to email us to get access.  Now you can log into our demonstration account right from the KidGenius main page!

We also added a *Personal Demonstration Request* button.  For those needing assistance exploring the tool, fill out the quick form and I'll reach out to help!
