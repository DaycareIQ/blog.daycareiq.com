Typically your day care provider will be able to answer many of your questions. You can also call the Ministry responsible for the subsidy directly at `1‑877‑644‑9992` or if you are calling from Edmonton `780‑644‑9992`.

###How Do I Apply For The Subsidy?###

There are currently two ways to apply for the Alberta Child Care Subsidy.

1. [You can apply directly on the Ministry website.](https://www.childcaresubsidy.gov.ab.ca/ccs/ccs_public.nsf/PS2?OpenForm)

2. You may also print off a form and fill it out by hand.

	You can mail the form into the following address:
	Human Services
	PO Box 1641, Station M
	Edmonton, AB T5J 2N9

Or you mail email your form to [hs.childcaresubsidy@gov.ab.ca](hs.childcaresubsidy@gov.ab.ca).
You can also fax your form to the following number `780‑422‑5692`.

**Be sure to also fill out and submit the [CRA Consent Applicant Declaration and Acknowledgement form.](http://humanservices.alberta.ca/documents/CDEV0022.pdf).**

###How Much Will I Get?###

This depends on many factors including income, where you live, how many children you have and how old they are. You are best to go on the Ministry website and use their [handy estimate tool](https://www.childcaresubsidy.gov.ab.ca/ccs/ccs_public.nsf/Estimator?OpenForm). It is only an estimate, once your application is accepted, the Ministry will inform you of your monthly subsidy.

###How Will I Get Paid?###

You won't actually receive a cheque from the government. The Government of Alberta will send your subsidy directly to your daycare provider. Your day care provider will deduct that amount from your monthly fees.

###I Got Denied Subsidy, Now What Do I Do?###

If you receive a letter from the Ministry stating that your subsidy was not approved, you have 30 days to appeal the decision. Fill out the following [form](http://humanservices.alberta.ca/documents/CDEV2250.pdf) and mail it back to the Ministry.

###My Child Has A Special Need, Can I Get The Subsidy?###

Of course, you just have to fill out an additional [form](http://humanservices.alberta.ca/documents/CS3610.pdf). This form also applies to parents with special needs that require care for their child. In both cases, you will need a signature by an authorized professional such as a medical doctor, psychologist, psychiatrist, counsellor or social worker. Submit this form with your general application.

###What If I Don't Want To Send My Kids To A Daycare, Are There Other Options For Subsidy?###

Yes, stayed tuned as we will be writing a whole article on other types of government subsidies.
