#Why Should Parents Choose DaycareIQ?

Parents have many options when researching child care.  We think DaycareIQ is your best option and I'm here to tell you why.

###DaycareIQ Makes Researching Child Care Easy
*  Our mapping tool allows you to filter by type of child care (day care, preschool, out of school care and more).  We also allow you to filter by age range accepted by the location.
*  We are the only tool in Alberta that allows you to toggle [accredited](https://blog.daycareiq.com/2015-alberta-daycare-accreditation/) facilities.
*  With DaycareIQ you can create a favourite list and show only those locations on the map, making it easier to visualize your options.
*  Inspections, Inspections, Inspections.  Parents tell us their favourite feature is the inspection data.  Most parents didn't even know it existed!  We have inspection data for **all** locations going back to 2013!

###DaycareIQ Makes Waitlisting for Child Care Easy
*  Waitlist for locations with a simple click - seriously!
*  Waitlist with 1 form instead of 5!  We find that parents tend to waitlist for 4-5 locations: 2 or 3 near their house, and 1 or 2 near their work.  Before DaycareIQ this meant 5 different forms and 5 different locations to drop them off.  That's a lot of work!  DaycareIQ allows you to waitlist for centres all with the same form.  Spend less time filling out paper work.
*  Keep track of all your waitlists!  We list the locations where each child is waitlisted at.

###DaycareIQ Makes Child Profiles Easy
*  Our online profile tool is one of the easiest and most user friendly out there.  Add your details and your spouses details in a snap.  Keep emergency contacts up to date with a few clicks.  All your children are under one account, **even if they go to completely different locations!**  This is unheard of!
*  You can update your childrens information in a few clicks.  For example, did your child just develop a slight allergy to kiwis?  Update your profile and your childcare operator will get an alert!

We have many more features that we think you will love.  We also have a ton more in the pipeline!  If your current child care provider isn't already using DaycareIQ, you should recommend it!  We think you, and your provider, will love it!
