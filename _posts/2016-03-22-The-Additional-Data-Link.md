On the DaycareIQ map, every location has a link to "Additional Data".  Where possible, we provided a link to the inspection data for the centre.  However this may vary depending on the province - find your province below to find out more information. 

### Alberta ###

For centres in Alberta, the _Additional Data_ link points to the [Province of Alberta's Child Care lookup page](http://www.humanservices.alberta.ca/oldfusion/ChildCareLookup.cfm).  The issue with this link is that the province of Alberta lists each program _within_ a centre as a separate entry.  For example, [Kids & Company - Red Deer](http://www.humanservices.alberta.ca/oldfusion/ChildCareLookup.cfm?s=search&sfid=&sinspd=&sinspc=&show=&sstype=pname&pname=kids+%26+company&pcity=RED+DEER++++++++++++&Lookup=Search&pcode=) has a daycare program and and out-of-school care program; they each get their own listing.  To make things easier, we list each location together, clumping all programs together.  Because of this, you may need to search for your desired location on the [provincial lookup tool](http://www.humanservices.alberta.ca/oldfusion/ChildCareLookup.cfm) to get all the various inspection data.  Email us if you would like more clarification!

### British Columbia ###

The province of BC is much more simple than it's eastern neighbour, Alberta.  The _Additional Data_ link points to the relevant inspection data for each location.  Simple as that!

### Manitoba ###

Manitoba does not make inspection data available online.  Instead, our _Additional Data_ link points to the provincial record for the child care centre or day home where users can get information like neighbourhood, school division, hours of operation, nearby bus routes among other info.

### New Brunswick ###

For New Brunswick locations, the _Additional Data_ link points to a recent inspection result for the facility.  To get the most up to date inspection info, we recommend searching for your favourite location on the [New Brunswick page](http://www1.gnb.ca/0000/Daycarecq/index-e.asp).

### Newfoundland and Labrador ###

Newfoundland and Labrador provides simple and easy access to their child care centre data.  On DaycareIQ, the _Additional Data_ link points to the locations webpage, where violations can be found!  Easy as pie!

### Nova Scotia ###

Nova Scotia is a province after our hearts - they provide an extensive and easy to access to inspection data.  One _Additional Data_ link is enough to give you all inspection data you need to make your decision!

### Ontario ###

Ontario is a tough province.  The nature of their website means that we cannot provide you a direct link to the centres listing _or_ their inspection data!  Our _Additional Data_ link points to the Ontario tool which can be used to search for your favourite location.  The Ontario tool does not have a map and that's why we think [DaycareIQ is a better tool for Ontario parents!](https://blog.daycareiq.com/2016-DaycareIQ-and-Ontario)

### Prince Edward Island ###

Like Ontario, the PEI site does not allow direct linking to centres or inspection information.  Therefore we provide a direct link to the [PEI tool](https://earlychildhooddevelopment.ca/ecregistry/search.php#a) so you can search for locations you are interested in.

### Quebec ###

Quebec provides great access to inspection data.  Our _Additional Data_ link points to the locations' inspection page.  From there, one click and you have the inspection data for your desired location!

### Saskatchewan ###

Like other provinces (Ontario and PEI), Saskatchewan does not allow direct links to sites or inspection data.  In fact they don't provide inspection data online at all!  We still link to [provincial tool](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/family-and-social-support/child-care/find-a-child-care-provider-in-my-community) so you can check it out.

The goal for DaycareIQ is to provide parents with the most accurate and complete data on child care centres across the country.  Unfortunately, because every province handles their early child education differently, we are limited in what we can offer.  If you ever have questions about a location or a province, please don't hesitate to contact us.  We are here to help! You can email me personally at craig@DaycareIQ.com.
